                <h2>IOT</h2>
                <p class="para">The Internet of things (IoT) describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks. The Internet of things encompasses electronics, communication, and computer science engineering. "Internet of things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>

                <h2>AI</h2>
                <p class="para">Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs. Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.

                <h2>ML</h2>
                <p class="para">Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.
