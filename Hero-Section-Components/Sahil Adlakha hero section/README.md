# My Hero Section Template Website

## Description
Thank you for reading this.If you find it interesting then please merge it.
In this, I have built a hero-section based on E-Learning platform. And I have named this website as "Grappler.com" (a fictitious name) to directly connect with GrapplTech community.
It is a simple template with an easily understandable code. I have used html for structure and css for styling and effects. I have made a simple single-page website template having a navbar with logo and items having links to different sections of webpage and a hero-section with text, button and hero-image.
